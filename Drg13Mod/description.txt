TFGMod is a mod developed for the final work to sumbit in UJI's videogame development degree.
It adds various items for each class (weapons,ammo, armors and an accessory) intended to be crafted and used before the
pre-bosses part of Pre-Hardmode. The main materials needed for the items are Wood, Gel, Iron, Silver/Tungsten, 
Vertebra/Rotten Chunk and Fallen Stars. The mod aims to better define each class identity while adding some tools to buff them.
